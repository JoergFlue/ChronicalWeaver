## Communication Tools & Methods

### Primary Communication Channels

#### GitHub Issues for Feature Requests
```markdown
Title: [UI] Feature Request - [Brief Description]

**Component**: [Conversation/Agents/Library/Settings]
**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**User Story**: As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

**Mockups/References**: [Attach images or links]
**Additional Context**: [Any other relevant information]
```

#### GitHub Issues for Bug Reports
```markdown
Title: [UI] Bug - [Brief Description]

**Component**: [Affected UI component]
**Severity**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

**Expected Behavior**: [What should happen]
**Actual Behavior**: [What actually happens]
**Screenshots**: [Attach screenshots]
**Environment**: [OS version, screen resolution, etc.]
```

#### Direct Feedback Sessions
- **Screen sharing** for real-time interface review
- **Loom recordings** for asynchronous detailed feedback
- **Figma comments** for design-specific feedback

### File-Based Feedback System

#### 1. Requirements Gathering (Use provided templates)
- `UI_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Overall UI/UX preferences
- `AGENT_UI_SPEC.md` - Detailed agent interface requirements
- Fill these out completely before implementation phases

#### 2. Structured Feedback (During development)
- `UI_FEEDBACK_TEMPLATE.md` - Copy for each feedback session
- Name files: `UI_FEEDBACK_YYYY-MM-DD_Phase[X].md`
- Include screenshots in `screenshots/` folder

#### 3. Design Iterations
- Create `mockups/` folder for design files
- Use consistent naming: `[Component]_[Version]_[Date].[ext]`
- Include both working files and exported images

## Design Iteration Process

### 1. Initial Design Phase
**My Process**:
1. Review your requirements documents
2. Create initial wireframes/mockups
3. Present design concepts with rationale
4. Gather your feedback and preferences

**Your Process**:
1. Review designs against your stated requirements
2. Provide specific feedback using templates
3. Indicate preferences and concerns
4. Suggest specific improvements

### 2. Refinement Phase
**Iterative Cycle**:
1. I implement feedback and create refined designs
2. You test updated interfaces (if functional)
3. We identify remaining issues and improvements
4. Repeat until design meets acceptance criteria

### 3. Implementation Phase
**Development Process**:
1. I implement approved designs in code
2. You test functional interfaces regularly
3. We adjust implementation based on real usage
4. Polish and optimize based on performance

## Feedback Guidelines

### Effective Feedback Principles

#### Be Specific
- ❌ "The button doesn't look right"
- ✅ "The Send button is too small and hard to find when typing"

#### Provide Context
- ❌ "This is confusing"
- ✅ "When I'm trying to configure an agent, I can't find where to set the system prompt"

#### Explain Impact
- ❌ "Change this color"
- ✅ "The red color makes me think there's an error when there isn't one"

#### Suggest Solutions When Possible
- ❌ "This workflow is bad"
- ✅ "This workflow is slow - could we add a shortcut button for common tasks?"

### Feedback Timing

#### Early Feedback (Wireframes/Mockups)
**Focus On**:
- Overall layout and information architecture
- Workflow and user journey
- Missing features or confusing elements
- Visual hierarchy and organization

#### Mid-Development Feedback (Functional Prototypes)
**Focus On**:
- Actual usability in real scenarios
- Performance and responsiveness
- Error handling and edge cases
- Workflow efficiency and shortcuts

#### Late Feedback (Polish Phase)
**Focus On**:
- Visual polish and consistency
- Accessibility and inclusive design
- Performance optimization
- Final user experience refinements

## Design Handoff Process

### From Requirements to Design
1. **Requirements Complete**: You fill out specification documents
2. **Design Planning**: I create design plan based on requirements
3. **Concept Review**: We review initial concepts together
4. **Approval to Proceed**: You approve overall direction

### From Design to Implementation
1. **Design Completion**: Mockups and specifications finalized
2. **Technical Planning**: I plan implementation approach
3. **Development**: Code implementation with regular check-ins
4. **Testing & Refinement**: You test and provide feedback

### From Implementation to Polish
1. **Feature Complete**: Core functionality working
2. **User Testing**: You use interface in realistic scenarios
3. **Polish Planning**: We identify areas for improvement
4. **Final Refinement**: Polish based on user testing

## Quality Standards

### UI Design Standards
- **Consistency**: Similar elements work the same way
- **Accessibility**: Usable by people with various abilities
- **Performance**: Responsive and smooth interactions
- **Clarity**: Purpose and function are obvious
- **Efficiency**: Common tasks are easy and fast

### Collaboration Standards
- **Responsiveness**: Feedback acknowledged within 24 hours
- **Clarity**: Questions and concerns clearly communicated
- **Documentation**: Decisions and changes documented
- **Respect**: Constructive feedback and open communication
- **Iteration**: Willingness to refine and improve
