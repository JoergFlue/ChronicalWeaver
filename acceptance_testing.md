# Acceptance Testing Coverage Report

## Phase 2 Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Short-term memory maintains conversation context within session
- [x] Long-term memory persists data across application restarts
- [x] SQLite database stores agent configurations, props, and interaction summaries
- [x] Memory systems integrate seamlessly with Main Agent
- [x] CRUD operations work for all data types
- [x] Memory can be queried and filtered effectively
- [ ] Database migrations work for schema updates
- [ ] Memory performance is acceptable for large conversation histories
- [x] Integration testing is performed to verify memory-agent and database interactions before and after each change

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/memory/test_models.py`)
- Model creation and field validation for Conversation, Message, AgentConfiguration, CharacterState, PropItem, ConversationSummary, UserPreference
- Basic CRUD for models

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/memory/test_memory_integration.py`)
- Conversation creation and persistence
- Message history loading
- Archiving and retrieving conversations

## Uncovered Criteria & Proposed Tests

- [ ] **Database migrations:** Add tests for schema migration scripts, verify data integrity after migration.
- [ ] **Query/filtering for all models:** Add integration tests for querying/filtering props, agent configs, character states, summaries, and user preferences.
- [ ] **Performance:** Add tests to simulate large conversation histories and measure query/memory performance.
- [ ] **CRUD for all data types:** Add tests for create/read/update/delete operations for props, agent configs, character states, and summaries.
- [ ] **Memory search:** Add tests for searching conversations, characters, and props by keywords.

## Proposed Test Checklist

- [ ] Test database migration scripts and verify schema changes
- [ ] Test querying/filtering for props, agent configs, character states, summaries, user preferences
- [ ] Test performance with large datasets (1000+ messages, 1000+ props)
- [ ] Test CRUD operations for all persistent data types
- [ ] Test memory search and retrieval accuracy

## Summary

Most core persistence and memory features are covered by unit and integration tests. Migration, advanced querying, performance, and search require additional tests for full acceptance coverage.
