# Phase 5: Polish, Testing & Deployment - Detailed Plan

## Implementation Confidence: 8/10

### Potential Problems
- E2E testing for PyQt6 UI may require custom test harnesses.
- PyInstaller packaging for Windows 11 can have hidden dependency issues.
- CI pipeline for build/test/deploy must be robust.

### Acceptance Tests
- UI/UX is refined, consistent, and passes usability checks.
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests pass on CI and local.
- Documentation is complete, up-to-date, and covers user/developer guides.
- PyInstaller produces a working Windows 11 executable with all dependencies.
- CI pipeline runs all tests and builds, reports status.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Refine UI/UX: polish layouts, add tooltips, improve accessibility.
2. Add E2E tests using Playwright/Selenium for PyQt6 UI (custom harness if needed).
3. Complete user and developer documentation: guides, API docs, troubleshooting.
4. Package app with PyInstaller, test on clean Windows 11 VM.
5. Ensure CI runs all tests and builds, add status badges to README.
6. Profile performance, fix bugs, and optimize.
7. Verify all acceptance tests pass.

# Phase 5 Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** PyInstaller misses dependencies. **Mitigation:** Use test VMs, document manual steps.
- **Risk:** E2E test flakiness. **Mitigation:** Use stable test data, retry logic.
- **Risk:** CI build failures. **Mitigation:** Incremental build/test, clear error reporting.
