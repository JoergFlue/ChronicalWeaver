# Phase 0: Planning & Foundation - Detailed Plan

## Implementation Confidence: 9/10

### Potential Problems
- Environment setup may vary across developer machines (Windows-specific issues).
- CI pipeline configuration for PyQt6 and CrewAI dependencies.

### Acceptance Tests
- Repository contains a clear directory structure: /ui, /agents, /memory, /llm, /images, /tests, /docs.
- README.md describes project, setup, and architecture.
- Python environment is reproducible via pipenv/poetry; requirements are locked.
- CI pipeline runs lint (flake8/black) and basic test job on push/PR.
- Initial documentation covers architecture, tech stack, and development practices.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Initialize Git repository, set up main and develop branches.
2. Create directory structure: /ui, /agents, /memory, /llm, /images, /tests, /docs.
3. Add README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and architecture diagram.
4. Add PROJECT.md and GPT_PLAN.md to /docs.
5. Set up pipenv/poetry, add Python 3.11+ requirement, lock dependencies.
6. Add initial requirements: PyQt6, CrewAI, LangChain, LiteLLM, pytest, flake8, black.
7. Configure CI (GitHub Actions): lint, test, build jobs.
8. Add initial documentation: /docs/architecture.md, /docs/dev_setup.md.
9. Verify all acceptance tests pass.

# Phase 0 Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Windows-specific dependency issues. **Mitigation:** Document setup for Windows, test on clean VM.
- **Risk:** CI fails on PyQt6/GUI dependencies. **Mitigation:** Use headless mode or mock UI for CI tests.
