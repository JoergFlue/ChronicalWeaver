# Phase 3: Agent Management & Core Sub-Agents - Detailed Plan

## Implementation Confidence: 7/10

### Potential Problems
- Dynamic agent configuration and delegation logic may be complex.
- UI for agent management must be intuitive and robust.
- Sub-agent orchestration and error handling.

### Acceptance Tests
- "Agents" tab UI lists, enables/disables, and configures agents with validation.
- Sub-agents (Prompt Tracking, Continuity Check) operate as described and log actions.
- MainAgent delegates tasks to sub-agents and receives results.
- Tests verify agent configuration, delegation, sub-agent logic, and error handling.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Build "Agents" tab UI: list, enable/disable toggles, config form, validation.
2. Implement Prompt Tracking and Continuity Check sub-agents (classes, interfaces).
3. Add delegation logic to MainAgent: task routing, result aggregation.
4. Connect agent config UI to backend, ensure persistence.
5. Write unit/integration tests for agent management, delegation, and sub-agent behaviors.
6. Document agent system and configuration options.
7. Verify all acceptance tests pass.

# Phase 3 Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Complex delegation logic. **Mitigation:** Start with simple delegation, expand iteratively.
- **Risk:** UI confusion for users. **Mitigation:** User testing, clear labels, tooltips.
- **Risk:** Sub-agent errors propagate. **Mitigation:** Robust error handling and logging.
