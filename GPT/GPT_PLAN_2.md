# Phase 2: Memory & Data Persistence - Detailed Plan

## Implementation Confidence: 7/10

### Potential Problems
- Integrating LangChain memory with custom agent logic.
- SQLite schema design for extensibility and performance.
- UI/Backend sync for CRUD operations.

### Acceptance Tests
- Short-term memory (ConversationBufferWindowMemory) stores and retrieves session context.
- Long-term memory (SQLite) persists summaries, agent configs, props, and clothing.
- CRUD operations for agents and props work via UI and backend, with validation.
- Unit/integration tests cover memory logic, persistence, and error handling.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Integrate LangChain's ConversationBufferWindowMemory with MainAgent.
2. Design SQLite schema: agents, props, clothing, summaries, images.
3. Implement backend CRUD for agents and props (models, controllers).
4. Build UI forms for agent and prop CRUD, connect to backend.
5. Connect MainAgent to both memory layers, ensure session/continuity logic.
6. Write unit/integration tests for memory, persistence, and CRUD.
7. Document memory architecture and data flow.
8. Verify all acceptance tests pass.

# Phase 2 Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Schema changes break data. **Mitigation:** Use migrations and versioning.
- **Risk:** Memory sync issues. **Mitigation:** Test edge cases, add logging.
- **Risk:** UI/Backend desync. **Mitigation:** Use integration tests and clear API contracts.
