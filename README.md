# Chronicle Weaver - AI-Driven Roleplaying Assistant

Chronicle Weaver is a user-friendly, AI-driven roleplaying assistant for Windows 11, designed to provide rich, continuous roleplay experiences through a modular agent system, flexible Large Language Model (LLM) backends, robust memory management, and integrated image generation.

## Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for different roleplay tasks
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Integration with OpenAI, Google Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio via LiteLLM
- **Memory Management**: Dual-layered memory system for short-term conversation and long-term continuity
- **Image Generation**: Support for DALL-E 3, Stability AI, and local generation (Automatic1111/ComfyUI)
- **Intuitive UI**: PyQt6-based desktop application with tabbed interface

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 11
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoergFlue/ChronicalWeaver.git
cd ChronicalWeaver
```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry (recommended):
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

Or using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

## Architecture

Chronicle Weaver follows a modular architecture with clearly separated components:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/          # PyQt6 user interface components
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/      # CrewAI agent implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ memory/      # Memory management (LangChain + SQLite)
â”œâ”€â”€ llm/         # LLM integration layer (LiteLLM)
â”œâ”€â”€ images/      # Image generation integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/       # Unit, integration, and E2E tests
â””â”€â”€ docs/        # Documentation and planning files
```

## Development

### Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: PyQt6
- **Agent Framework**: CrewAI
- **LLM Integration**: LiteLLM
- **Memory**: LangChain + SQLite
- **Image Generation**: Multiple API integrations
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
