# Chronicle Weaver - Agent Management UI Specification

## Overview
This document captures requirements for the Agent Management interface, which is the most complex UI component in Chronicle Weaver. This interface allows users to create, configure, and manage AI agents with specialized roles.

## Agent Management Concepts

### What Are Agents?
- **Specialized AI assistants** that handle specific tasks
- **Configurable behavior** through system prompts and settings
- **Enable/disable functionality** to control which agents are active
- **Performance monitoring** to track agent effectiveness

### Core Agent Types
1. **Main Agent**: Orchestrates conversations and delegates tasks
2. **Prompt Tracking Agent**: Logs interactions and provides analytics
3. **Continuity Check Agent**: Monitors story consistency
4. **Search Agent**: Finds relevant information from web/databases
5. **Prop Agent**: Manages items and suggests props for scenes
6. **Alternate Sub-Ego Agent**: Enables personality switching
7. **Custom Agents**: User-created agents with specific roles
