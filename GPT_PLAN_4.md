# Phase 4: Image Generation & Advanced Features - Detailed Plan

## Implementation Confidence: 6/10

### Potential Problems
- API integration for image generation may have rate limits, authentication, or format issues.
- UI for image display and metadata management can be complex.
- Library tab CRUD and image linking to props/clothing.

### Acceptance Tests
- Image generation APIs (DALL-E 3, Stability AI, local) are abstracted and callable with error handling.
- "Generate Image" button in UI triggers image creation and displays results inline or in viewer.
- Images and metadata are stored in SQLite and retrievable via UI.
- "Library" tab UI manages props/clothing with images, supports CRUD.
- Tests cover image generation, display, metadata, and library CRUD.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Implement image generation abstraction for DALL-E 3, Stability AI, Automatic1111 APIs (mock/test keys).
2. Add "Generate Image" button and display logic to UI (inline, popup viewer).
3. Store images and metadata in SQLite, link to props/clothing.
4. Build "Library" tab UI for item management, image preview, CRUD.
5. Write unit/integration tests for image generation, display, and library features.
6. Document image generation and library architecture.
7. Verify all acceptance tests pass.

# Phase 4 Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** API rate limits or downtime. **Mitigation:** Use retries, mock APIs for tests.
- **Risk:** UI complexity for image display. **Mitigation:** Start with simple inline display, expand to viewer.
- **Risk:** Metadata sync issues. **Mitigation:** Test CRUD thoroughly, add logging.
